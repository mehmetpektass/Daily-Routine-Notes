# My Daily Journal üìù

## Description

My Daily Journal is a simple web application built using Express.js and EJS that allows users to compose, view, and read daily journal entries. The application utilizes SQLite3 as the database to store journal entries. Users can navigate through different sections of the website such as home, about, contact, and compose new journal entries.
